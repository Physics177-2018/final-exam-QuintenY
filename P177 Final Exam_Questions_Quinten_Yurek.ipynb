    "I think I enjoyed either the poissons' equation with the E Field mapping or the Ising model. From poissons' eq I learned how to integrate, in code, a partial differential equation. This was interesting because it forced us to break apart the integral to its core which is a summation for a function of some variables. The Ising model was similar but I enjoyed the probability and the outcome png file and how the system evolved over time. "

I was able to shift enter through most of the hw then look up some functions to finish it. But the problem was I did not understand what I was doing. I think this began with the bessel functions. However, there were some programs I understood both on paper and in code. I just had never used python before and it went from \"print hello world\" to manage a n-dimensional array which I had no idea how to do in python. So, I looked it up and shift entered some code and through trial and error kind of figured it out but I still do not formally know.  *"

    "*after we did the the drop of creamer in the coffee model I look at the world differently. I oddly stir my coffee with my face very close watching the creamer and coffee mix and am like this is fucking nuts. Now I think of diffusion of gasses I cannot see a lot. When I use the AC in at my house in riverside when its hot I think about how the hallway has no vents so it is always hotter and when I open my door I think of this complicated diffusion going on in my doorway between the hot and cold areas. I would like to model this system with a mcmc program. MCMC works by choosing a random point to look within the system (monte carlo) at and then, based on parameters unique to the problem, decides how the next step should be taken (markov chain). this process iterates over the whole system for many steps*"

Now imagine you want to color in everything under the lines but all you have are rectangles with different heights. A Riemann summ is coloring in everything under the line, but we use the rectangles. Then we  add them all up. But not so fast, each rectangle has a different height so you need to add each rectangle individually and take into consideration its unique height.  "

When you begin to introduce harder physics problems which is awesome because those were the most fun, you also should consider teaching the python concepts along with them. Like how python code is structured and how the core functions work. Managing an array (most important), knowing how values get updated and the function, class, object relations are things I think would be good to formally teach in this class. And an overview of syntax should deffinatly be taught, since we only learned markdown syntax.\n",
